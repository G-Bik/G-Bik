- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @G-Bik aka Gustut Biksa
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Full Stack Developer and Backend Developer, SQL Databases, Python as Backend, and all skill for the role.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript based on learning Roadmap.sh to becoming Backend Developer
- ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m looking to get hired on company that give me a chance to role as Backend Developer, it's will awsome to me
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I hold a bachelor's degree in IT with a focus on database and SQL skills. My studies included integrating data from different databases using Python, which was the last programming skill I actively used back in 2019, the year I graduated. However, instead of pursuing a career in IT, I chose to work in the hospitality industry as part of the accounting team, where I gained valuable accounting skills and experience,particularly in my role as a storeman.
